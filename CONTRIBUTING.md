# Contributing to the ghūl compiler

Thanks for your interest. Bug reports, language questions, documentation fixes
and code are all welcome.

This is the compiler for the [ghūl programming language](https://ghul.dev), and
it is written in ghūl itself. That shapes almost everything below, so it is
worth reading the [self-hosting](#self-hosting-and-the-bootstrap-rule) section
even if you skip the rest.

Automated contributors have a few extra rules in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md); the
requirements on this page apply to them too.

## Reporting a bug

Open an [issue](https://github.com/degory/ghul/issues/new/choose). The most
useful bug report is a short program that shows the problem, plus what you
expected to happen and what happened instead. A program that is a few lines long
and compiles on its own is worth far more than a description of a problem inside
a large project.

If the compiler reported an internal error, include the whole message.

## Asking about the language

If you are not sure whether something is a bug or the language working as
designed, ask. [GHUL.md](./GHUL.md) is the language reference and the
[website](https://ghul.dev) covers the same ground at more length, but both are
works in progress and the compiler does not always agree with them. A question
that turns out to be a documentation gap is a useful contribution in itself.

## Setting up

You need the [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0).
Nothing else is required - the compiler that builds this repository is itself a
.NET tool, restored into the working tree:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/degory/ghul.git
cd ghul
dotnet tool restore
dotnet build
```

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with the
[ghūl extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=degory.ghul)
gives you diagnostics, hover, completion and go-to-definition while you work.

## Self-hosting and the bootstrap rule

The compiler compiles itself. When you change `src/`, your change is compiled by
the **previously published** release of `ghul.compiler`, not by the compiler your
branch produces.

The practical consequence catches everyone out once: **a compiler feature cannot
be used in `src/` in the same change that adds it.** The published compiler has
never heard of it, so the build fails before your version exists. Add the
feature in one pull request; start using it in `src/` in a later one, after the
first has been released.

The version pinned in `.config/dotnet-tools.json` is only a local fallback so
that `dotnet tool restore` has some compiler to run. CI resolves the latest
published release at run time and builds with that, so that is the version your
change actually has to satisfy. To match CI locally:

```sh
dotnet tool update --local ghul.compiler
```

Never commit a manifest pinned to a `0.0.0-*` local version - it breaks the
build for everyone else.

`./build/bootstrap.sh` is the check that self-hosting still works. It builds the
compiler with itself four times over and compares the output of the last two
passes, which must be identical.

## Testing

Everything below must pass before a pull request can merge, and CI runs all of
it on every pull request. Run what is relevant to your change locally; there is
no need to run the whole suite yourself, because CI will.

| Suite | Command | Time | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | `dotnet test unit-tests` | seconds | Deliberately selective - see [Changing the type system](#changing-the-type-system) for the exception |
| Integration | `dotnet publish --output publish/ && dotnet ghul-test integration-tests` | ~3 min | Snapshot-based; see [integration-tests/README.md](integration-tests/README.md) |
| Cross-assembly | `dotnet publish --output publish/ && dotnet ghul-test --use-dotnet-build cross-assembly-tests` | ~1 min | Real MSBuild projects; see [cross-assembly-tests/README.md](cross-assembly-tests/README.md) |
| Analysis | `dotnet test analysis-tests` | seconds | Drives the language-service mode the editor extension uses |
| Bootstrap | `./build/bootstrap.sh` | ~1-2 min | Self-hosting; produces little output until each pass finishes |

**Publish before running the integration or cross-assembly tests.** Both find the
compiler under `publish/`. Skip the publish step and they quietly test the last
*published* compiler instead of your change, and pass regardless of what you did.

Times are from a reasonably fast machine, and can be several times longer in a
container or on a small VM.

### Adding a test

Any change in behaviour needs a test. Integration tests are the main net, and
`./integration-tests/create.sh` scaffolds one. They live in four groups by what
they assert:

- `integration-tests/execution` - the program builds, runs, and prints the
  expected output.
- `integration-tests/il` - the emitted IL.
- `integration-tests/parse` - parse errors and warnings.
- `integration-tests/semantic` - semantic errors and warnings.

Each test is a directory of ghūl source plus `*.expected` snapshot files;
`./tasks/capture.sh <test-directory>` promotes what the compiler currently
produces into those snapshots. Check what it captured before committing it - 
capture records the behaviour that exists, which is only the behaviour you want
if your change is already correct.

A test for a bug fix should fail before your fix and pass after it. Check that
it does, rather than assuming.

### Changing the type system

The type system and inference machinery - `src/semantic/types/`,
`src/semantic/symbols/`, `src/semantic/overload_resolver.ghul`, the inference
paths in `src/syntax/process/compile-expressions/compile_expressions.ghul`, and the IR value gates
around them - are the most fragile part of the compiler. A patch that works in
isolation can still interact badly with constraint accumulation, least-upper-bound
widening, retry-loop convergence, or IL emission. So the bar here is higher than
"the integration tests pass":

- **Put new logic in its own class, with a single clear responsibility.** Prefer
  a small new class to another long method on an existing one.
- **Consolidate duplication the change reveals.** Don't refactor speculatively,
  but when one change shows you the same logic in two places, move it somewhere
  focused rather than copying it a third time.
- **Add unit tests under `unit-tests/src/`** pinning the behaviour you care
  about. A fast fixture around a small class is far easier to maintain than an
  integration test through the whole pipeline, and it documents what the class
  is supposed to guarantee.
- **Pin behaviour that looks wrong, too.** If you find a corner case that
  behaves oddly and you are not fixing it here, still add a test recording what
  it does today, with a comment saying what looks wrong and what the right
  answer would be. A later change then either flips the test deliberately, with
  the reasoning visible in the diff, or notices it broke something.

Unit tests go in `unit-tests/src/`, one file per class under test, named
`<class>_tests.ghul`. See the files already there for the `@test()` annotation
and assertion conventions.

## Documentation

If you work something out that should have been written down, write it down.
When a `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GHUL.md`, this file, or the explanatory
comment at the top of a source file turns out to be wrong or unclear, fix it as
part of your change.

Don't delete instructions from those files without asking first - something you
can see no reason for is often load-bearing.

Code comments are a different matter: the default is not to write one. Comment
where a reader who knows the codebase would still need the context - a
non-obvious invariant, an ordering requirement, a workaround whose reason isn't
visible from the code. Don't narrate what the code does, and don't write
comments that only make sense to someone who read the pull request.

## Pull requests

Pull requests are squash-merged, so **the description becomes the commit message
and the release-notes entry**. It is the one part of a pull request that lasts,
and it is worth more care than the individual commit messages.

Write it for someone reading `git log` in a few years with no other context.
Open directly with one or more of these sections - they are plain text, not
markdown headings:

```plaintext
Enhancements:
- Something a user of the language or the compiler would notice (closes #1234)

Bugs fixed:
- What was broken, phrased as the issue title is (closes #1235)

Technical:
- An internal change: a refactor, a test, a build tweak
```

Use only the sections you have content for, and keep every bullet to one line.
A typical description is under fifteen lines in total.

What does **not** go in the description:

- `## Summary`, `## Overview`, `## Test plan` or `## Testing` headings. The
  description is the summary, and passing CI is implied.
- Justification. State what changed; don't argue that it was right.
- A prose preamble explaining the problem. The bullet says it in one line.
- Links that won't outlive the pull request.

Anything a reviewer needs but a changelog reader does not - why this approach
over an obvious alternative, an oddity that is deliberate, an invariant the diff
doesn't reveal - is genuinely useful, and belongs in a **comment on the pull
request**. Comments aren't part of the squashed commit, so nothing there is
constrained by the rules above. Most pull requests need no comment; reach for
one when a reviewer would otherwise reasonably flag something that is fine.

Other things worth knowing:

- Keep the title under about seventy characters. Don't append the pull request
  number - GitHub does that on merge.
- Every pull request needs a passing CI run and an approving review before it
  can merge, and its branch must be up to date with `main`.
- Source files use Unix line endings. The one deliberate exception is
  `integration-tests/parse/carriage-returns/test.ghul`, which is test data.
- If a test fails and you cannot see how your change caused it, say so in the
  pull request rather than working around it. The same goes for a test that
  passes and fails at random.

## Contributing from a fork

You do not need write access to this repository. Fork it, push a branch to your
fork, and open a pull request against `main` here.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<you>/ghul.git
cd ghul
git remote add upstream https://github.com/degory/ghul.git
dotnet tool restore
git switch -c my-change
```

When `main` moves on underneath you, bring your branch up to date - the merge
button stays disabled until you do:

```sh
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

CI behaves differently for a pull request from a fork, in ways that are worth
knowing before they surprise you:

- **The first one you open waits for a maintainer.** GitHub holds workflow runs
  from a new contributor until someone approves them, so expect no checks at all
  for a while. This is normal and is not a problem with your branch.
- **The tests run on GitHub's runners rather than this repository's**, so they
  are slower than the timings above. Everything else about them is the same, and
  the full suite still has to pass.
- **Two jobs are skipped.** GitHub withholds repository secrets from a fork - 
  correctly, since anyone can open a pull request. The automated code review and
  the beta package publish both need them, so both sit out. A maintainer reviews
  your change by hand instead, which is also how it gets the approval it needs to
  merge.

Nothing about a fork stops a change being merged. It just means a person, rather
than a workflow, does the reviewing.
