# Format the compiler's own source and build the result.
#
# The formatter is the AST serializer, so its output has to parse back to
# the same tree. Nothing else tests that: the formatter's unit and
# analysis-mode tests each check one construct against a snapshot, and a
# snapshot only says the output is what it was last time, not that it is
# still ghul. This runs the whole compiler through it and builds what
# comes out, which is the check the tool actually exists to pass.
#
# It also requires the formatter to be a fixpoint on its own output: a
# formatter that is not rewrites files that were already formatted, so
# every reformat shows up as a diff and the tool cannot be run on save.
# The first pass is allowed to change things, since it is normalising
# source a person wrote; it is the second pass onwards that must not.
