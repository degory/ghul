# Quick ghÅ«l example projects

This folder contains a tiny library and a console application that uses it. Both projects are configured to build using the **local** compiler from the repository's `publish` folder.

To run the console application:

```sh
dotnet publish --output publish
cd examples/hello-app
dotnet run
```
