### Development environment

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) will give you rich language support via the [ghūl VSCode language extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=degory.ghul).

### Runtime dependencies for ghūl applications

## Gotchas

This is an incomplete compiler for an experimental programming language. The ghūl language is sufficiently expressive and the compiler stable enough for the [compiler itself to be writen in ghūl](https://github.com/degory/ghul). However, there will be [compiler bugs](https://github.com/degory/ghul/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug)
