# Tests
No in-process unit testing framework, because a compiler bug could easily bring the whole test process down catestrophically, both code under test and the framework itself. Instead the test scripts capture warnings and errors generated by the compiler as each test is built, capture the output of the test executable as it runs, then compare the results against previously captured expected output.

- To run a specific test from Visual Studio Code, navigate to the ghÅ«l source file for the test (usually test/cases/.../test.ghul) and press CTRL+SHIFT+T
- To run all tests from Visual Studio Code, navigate to a non-test source file and press CTRL+SHIFT+T

- To run a specific test from the command line run `./dev-test test-case-name`, where 'test-case-name' is the name of the directory under test/cases containing that test's files
- To run all tests from the command line run `./dev-test.sh`

- To capture expected test output for a test case, run `./dev-capture.sh test-case-name`
