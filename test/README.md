# Tests
No in-process unit testing framework, because a compiler bug could easily bring the whole test process down catastrophically, both code under test and the framework itself. Instead the test scripts capture warnings and errors generated by the compiler as each test is built, capture the output of the test executable as it runs, then compare the results against previously captured expected output.

- To run a specific test from the command line run `./test test-case-name`, where 'test-case-name' is the name of the directory under test/cases containing that test's files
- To run all tests from the command line run `./test.sh`

- To capture expected test result for a test case, run `./capture.sh test-case-name` (note: a test must have previously been run and produced output before that output can be captured as the expected result)
