Function generic argument types should only be wildcards when binding

Function generic argument types should only be wildcards for purposes of 
function overload resolution, but they're currently wildcards for all type 
comparisons, including for code within the method.

the following should result in compile time errors, as the assignments of t and u to i and s involve incompatible types:

function[T,U](t: T, u: U) -> (T,U) is
    let i: int = t;
    let s: string = u;
si
