The following should all produce compile time errors:

 Assignment from a void value
 Passing a void value into a function call as an argument
 Passing a void value to a built in operator
 Passing a void value to a user defined operator function
 Attempting to access a member of a void value
 Checking if a value of void type is null with the '?' operator
 Comparing a void value to anything for equality

(All but the last two are already covered by other tests)
